# Trigger_word_detection


Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.
For this exercise, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound.
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."


I am going to do in this project:
Structure a speech recognition project
Synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets
Train a trigger word detection model and make predictions
